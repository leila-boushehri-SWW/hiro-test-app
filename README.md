# Blue Lens (Expo / React Native)

This repository has been migrated from a Vite + React (web) app to an **Expo (React Native)** app that can run in **Expo Go**.

## Run (Expo Go)

1. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the dev server:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

3. Open **Expo Go** on your phone and scan the QR code.

## Implemented screens

- `app/index.tsx` (Welcome / splash)
- `app/welcome-intro.tsx` (WelcomeIntro slides)
- `app/home.tsx` (Home)

## Where the old web app went

The original web/Vite project (including its build config files) was moved to `./web/` for reference.
